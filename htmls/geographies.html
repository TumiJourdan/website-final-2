                Information has always had a geography? Is this true?
                <br>
                Manifesto of futurism – About present and future, discard the past
                <br>
                -	the one that is tired of stale and unproductive adherence to the past
                <br>
                -	idea of progress, rejection of the past and creation of new aesthetics, of novel beauty found in war and destruction,
                <br>
                -	its significance greatly surpasses national borders
                <br>
                Information is mobile, has location, movement and change. It changes itself and its context.
                Information can be moved without changed, (IMP it doesn’t contextualise itself as it travels.
                <br>
                
                Information becomes an attribute of objects, there is the object, peoples opinions, maps, data all of which are immutable.
                <br>
                Although we cannot travel to a place, the informational attribute is something that we are able to access globally.
                <br>
                This attribute can also affect the object. So when people manipulate the information attributes, they can to a degree manipulate/change the object itself.
                <br> <br>
                <h2>Pre-digital geographies of information</h2> 
                <br><br>
                Pre-digital the information’s viewer base was very limited. And the creators of the information was smaller.
                <br>
                The institutions/groups of people who could create the information have internal external context.
                The places that generated this information was most often the ruling, the subordinate did not have the resources.
                <br>
                More information was produced in the North than the south. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Changing geographies after the information
                    revolution?</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                Paper describes how information age, information is more widely spread in use. How does this affect information geographics. To answer this :
                <br>
                -	Who can access the information now
                <br>
                -	Where is information generated the most
                <br>
                -	For whom is the information created
                <br>
                (IMP : these questions seem gaged to an answer, it seems like the writer may know where the answers lead and formulates the questions based of preconceived assumptions, I wonder if there is a more biased methodology to explore the hypothesis.)
                <br>
                They collect data based on nations. Has its pitfalls but is where most info is available.

                The largest China, India have still space to grow. Many countries in Africa have allow low internet penetration.
                <br>
                Affordability
                <br>
                The affordability of internet is extremely low in parts of Africa is extremely high, less people can afford.
                <br>
                Cost is a key barrier.

                <h2>                Geographies of participation
                </h2>
                <br><br>
                Western world holds78% of domain names = largest content creation.
                Areas with similar populations have the western counterparts with more domain names.

                <br>
                Once again western world with most commits.
                (IMP: as a gamer I know that the majority of games and players reside in the Asian world. If we were to take game servers into account we would find very different results. Due to the large player base some games have had to create multiple servers for china alone, and not a single server in all of Africa.)
                Regardless of whether there are substitutes of these programs, it doesn’t change the fact that the rest of the world consumes the same media that is dominated by the European / western powers.

                <h2>                Critical Analysis of the paper.
                </h2>
                <br>
                North has more representation and more participation. I can’t find any fault in the conclusions made by the paper. This may be due to some concepts that escape my reach. But I find the lack of rebuttal from me to be born from the papers’ lack of comment.  It doesn’t say why these problems have come to be, or how it could end. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For instance: is this a problem that is merely due to economic differences? And if so, will it slowly change and balance as countries join the developed world. Meaning that is but a reality that is that is wholly dependent to the economic development of the country.
                The answer to this question for me is yes. Looking at this paper: https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/02/22/internet-access-growing-worldwide-but-remains-higher-in-advanced-economies/
                It is seen that web participation is closely linked to the GDP per capita of a country.
                <br>
                <br>
                Concerning participation shown by domain names and Wikipedia pushes.
                I can’t find any papers giving a why. So, I will give my own opinion. America is a consumerist nation, in this paper it shows that America, in consumer expenditure, is 3-fold larger than the next country [1].
                This means that there are more people who want to buy items, and consume digital content (I assume), therefore more domain names for websites are created to pander to its insatiable audience. 
                     Although I have found no research papers indicating that these two attributes are dependant on one another, my thought compels me to say that the extreme consumerism of the country plays a large role regarding the participation and creation of internet content in America. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What does this mean for the world and developing countries? (My opinion) I do not see this changing until another country surpasses the gluttony of America, or America undergoes a drastic cultural change ( maybe due to an economic collapse but that is speculation).
                <br> 
                The only solution that I ( a 23 year old student who has very little experience of the world) can think of : is making the masses more aware of how the information age is not objective and as many dominating narratives that preside over the media we consume. 
                <br>
                This is similar to the point made by the Medium as the Message, that various medias can affect the unconscious human, and so something that can be done in the foreseeable future is to educate people to be conscious of the medias that they partake in. For instance the Interactive Media course has made many more people aware of themselves and the digital age.
