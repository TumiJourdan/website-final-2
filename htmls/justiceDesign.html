          <br>
            <br>
           <h2>Abstract</h2> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>            There are systems and people that do not accommodate for one another. These people and systems should be educated to better understand and best help the users with least friction and value infringement as possible.
            </p>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>  
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>            It is clear as day that technology and software marginalise minorities. Looking at source [1] and [2] cases of this occurring are abundant. Now we know this is undesirable and wish to stop it. I will be looking at why it is happening and then what do we do about it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Why</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>            It is first and foremost of great import to recognise that the software humans produce , are not born out of and into vacuums. The context surrounding them impacts their development and the software itself impacts the environment around it. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>            I bring emphasis to this as in the video [2], believing that software is unbiased, and bears no responsibility is a very “Software Thinking” method. Many entities strive to remove humans from processes to further atomise, but these atomisation systems handle other humans and influence them, and the systems currently cannot reason and analyse the effects they are having on humans, whilst humans can.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What brings us to these pitfalls, where technology fails us in unforeseen ways, is the unwarranted confidence in software. Although software is an incredible tool it is made by and exists among humans, and so error will occur. To reduce this companies must become more hesitant and inquisitive as to how what may seem to be a simple answer to a specific problem, may have affects beyond what we imagine. A great solution to help companies stay their hands on decisions, is to have an open dialogue with its employees and generate a space where questioning ones boss is promoted.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>            Looking at both sources the situations that lead to marginalisation of people could have been avoided with more open minded and inquisitive approaches, with less faith in software solving everything, but I believe the sources do not cover (what is in my opinion) the most important reason. Capitalism and individualism. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>            These two driving forces will stamp out a lot (not all) attempts to improve justice within design. Because the bottom line to these forces is whether these solutions will make money. The company often does not exist to provide the world with an enriching product or service, but usually is primarily focused on making more money.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>                From this I conclude that as much as we may try incorporate better ethics and rules will help , but the problem is rather a cultural one. These companies do not find effectively incorporating inclusive systems to have monetary gain, and it doesn’t, so they will not. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>What to do</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Education and much more. Although many of the solutions do not fix the core problem of monetary driven entities, they are still of merit. No matter how small the impact, it is still a step into the right direction. 
            Regarding education, this course is a prime example. By teaching the people and making them aware of the problems will contribute to the gradual shift of our globalised culture. Creating organisations, and communities will further spread the awareness to people around the world.
            <br>
            Minorities are majorities
            <br>
            <br>
            Something of my own opinion. A few hundred years back, communities were isolated and much more homogenous, unlike today where globalisation connects most humans, and cities can reach populations of millions. Because of this, any group that is a small percentage of the population, is a large amount of people. For instance 2 percent of America is around 6.5 million people, even though that is an exceedingly small percentage, it is a lot of humans. Adding the internet and globalisation, these minorities are creating communities. 
            With the shear amount of people that are minorities, they can no longer be considered fringe, or edge cases. As any system that excludes 2 percent of all internet users (5 billion) is excluding 100 million humans.
        </p>
            

<br><br>
            
            <h2>
                Feelings, expecting circumstances, expecting marginalisation. 

            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Being marginalised is a terrible experience, and as in [1] being marginalised so often that it is to be expected is deplorable. As [1] showed, within airports alone, the excusatory nature of the systems encompasses many and large communities. Each case presented in [1] had the customer have their values and interests disregarded, on multiple occasions, this kind of behaviour causes the person to feel singled out and differentiated against. The disregard for the human experience of these people has 2 roots (in my opinion). 

            </p>
                <br>
                <p>  The second root cause is once again the capitalism. What is the monetary gain of including other people in these systems? To create protocols, training and implement training for when handling these groups cost the companies a lot, and currently there is no incentive for them. As the number one priority is to make money, and not to make an accommodating experience for all humans.</p>
            <h2> Personal voice</h2>
           <br> As I am not a marginalised person I can see that there is a certain amount of understanding that I lack. And so all the above are biased opinions from my relative position. 
           Something I have not touched on is the systematic oppression and racism. It is bad, it hurts peoples feelings, as to how one would go about fixing these things is not something I can’t cover in 1 essay. The effort would be futile relative to the papers that already exist that tackle this problem. <br>
