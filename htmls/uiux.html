        <br>
        UI and UX. The UI helps the user navigate the page the UX is the emotional connection.
        They work in combination to guide the consumers eyes and actions. 
        As the designer, not only do I want to make the website easy to navigate but also to form an idea/story within the user to infer an opinion of me. 
        Ease of use and manipulation.
<br>
        With these core goals I will now go over what decisions I have made, critically comment on them and then discuss what can be done to futher improve my website. 
<br>
       <h3>Colouring</h3> 
        The colours of the website were specifically give the website a modern and technical feel. Blue, and shades (black to white) worked well to this end.
        The missed opportunity is using this simple palette to create contrasting and unique elements. For instance, yellow could be added to the scheme to draw the readers eyes to very important elements of the website. And an employ me action button may work well to draw the users attention and call to action.
<br>
        <h3>Font</h3>
        An important part of font is to create a set of ‘rules’ that the user can understand. For instance of all interactable buttons have the same font, if any new buttons are added to different areas of the page, the user will be able to infer that they can be pressed based on their similarities.
        The font of my initial hand in was atrocious. The only consistent fonts were the pixel fonts at the top of the page. 
<br>
        The story of the fonts: here the hand in font was appropriate as the heading fonts were purposefly made in a 8-bit pixel art theme. This part of the website tries to convey to the user that I am a game designer without telling them. 
<br>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        Almost everything is symmetrical. Why? I have struggled to find what layout is best for me, and what each layout conveys, but I have kept it consistent throughout the website. If I am unable to find which is best (although time consuming) prototype multiple designs and have them tested by users.
        No scrolling. This makes it easier for me to control what the user sees. When the user can scroll it is hard to know where they will stop, and so how the layout will be presented to them? 
        Visual designs.
        Buttons-change color on hover. This tells the user that it can be interacted with. The consistency also allows the user to discover what is and isn’t interactable on their own by probing each element with the hovering cursor. 
<br>
<h3>Visual designs.</h3>

<br>
<h3>Additions to website</h3>
<br>
<h3>User cantered design</h3>
<br>
As I continued adding content, the idea that the user will not have to scroll washed away. This was futher accentuated by user testing. 
I had decided to watch some friends interact with the site and observe. According to It’s not you. Bad doors are everywhere,  this is the first step regarding user centered design. During observation I noticed that sometimes the users didn’t know that they could scroll. 
I had 2 solutions in mind :
1.	Move elements so that the user can see there is more if they scroll down
2.	Add an arrow indicating that there is more content to be explored below. 
The problem with option 1 is that every time I add new content I need to make sure that it clips at the bottom of the page. While option 2 will always work. 
I added an arrow that points down, but my scripts were not working. I had tried multiple times to hide and show an arrow, but after 3 hours of failure, I gave up, would have been nice.


<h3>Use of an external API</h3>

<br>
One of the responses I often received is how static my website seemed. The users didn’t feel like the website was something to be interacted with but more of a still image to be viewed. The only step I had taken regarding feedback are the buttons and sizeable project images. 
<br>
Since clicking on objects already have feedback, the only other information to be displayed is the scrolling of the webpage and the movement of the mouse. 
<br>
Both of these can be solved using the anime.js. 
As for the movement of the mouse I would like a sphere to slightly track the mouse from the centre of the screen. 
And the arrows to animate if the user scrolls.
Once these are added they will give all and any possible feedback to the user.
Alas, once again none of my scripts work.
